booksent_2013_0001	There would be time enough to send it before the messenger should go to the village.
booksent_2013_0002	David playing to Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion. 
booksent_2013_0003	I found her where I had found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance. 
booksent_2013_0004	I knew what she meant and I replied with a negative headshake. 
booksent_2013_0005	Still, all this while, nothing more passed between us save that Flora had let her foolish fern again drop to the ground. 
booksent_2013_0006	She had already got back her gaiety, and appeared to take this as an answer quite sufficient.
booksent_2013_0007	Prepared and on her guard as our pursuit had actually made her, she would repress every betrayal.
booksent_2013_0008	I could only grasp her more quickly yet, for even while she spoke the hideous plain presence stood undimmed and undaunted.
booksent_2013_0009	I must have lain there long and cried and sobbed, for when I raised my head the day was almost done. 
booksent_2013_0010	I have likened it to a sentinel, but its slow wheel, for a moment, was rather the prowl of a baffled beast.
booksent_2013_0011	My present quickened courage, however, was such that, not too much to let it through, I had to shade, as it were, my flame.
booksent_2013_0012	He was soon at some distance from me, still breathing hard and again with the air, though now without anger for it, of being confined against his will. 
booksent_2013_0013	He could not be accountable for his children's want of spirits, or for her want of enjoyment in his company.
booksent_2013_0014	At the end of the first dance, Captain Tilney came towards them again, and, much to Catherine's dissatisfaction, pulled his brother away. 
booksent_2013_0015	To have her acquaintance with the Tilneys end so soon was an evil which nothing could counterbalance.
booksent_2013_0016	The past suspense of the morning had been ease and quiet to the present disappointment.
booksent_2013_0017	Her grateful and gratified heart could hardly restrain its expressions within the language of tolerable calmness.
booksent_2013_0018	With a mind thus full of happiness, Catherine was hardly aware that two or three days had passed away, without her seeing Isabella for more than a few minutes together.
booksent_2013_0019	To doubt her truth or good intentions was impossible; and yet, during the whole of their conversation her manner had been odd.
booksent_2013_0020	That he should think it worth his while to fancy himself in love with her was a matter of lively astonishment. 
booksent_2013_0021	He might be jealous of her brother as a rival, but if more had seemed implied, the fault must have been in her misapprehension.
booksent_2013_0022	She had resisted its approaches during the whole length of a speech, but it now carried her captive. 
booksent_2013_0023	She blamed herself for the extent of her fears, and resolved never to think so seriously on the subject again. 
booksent_2013_0025	His eyes were ominous and his expression somewhat petulant except when startlingly illuminated by one of his frequent smiles.
booksent_2013_0026	Clark stared straight in front of him at a bolt on the clattering wind shield.
booksent_2013_0027	Half closing her eyes and tipping back her head till it rested on the seat back she let the savory breeze fan her eyes and ripple the fluffy curls of her bobbed hair.
booksent_2013_0028	"She called Sally Carrol ""Sally,"" and could not be persuaded that the double name was anything more than a tedious ridiculous nickname. "
booksent_2013_0029	Of all the men she met she preferred Roger Patton, who was a frequent visitor at the house. 
booksent_2013_0030	They passed a little girl done up in gray wool until she resembled a small Teddy bear, and Sally Carrol could not resist a gasp of maternal appreciation.
booksent_2013_0031	To be beneath great piles of it all winter long, where even her headstone would be a light shadow against light shadows.
booksent_2013_0032	On a tall hill outlined in vivid glaring green against the wintry sky stood the ice palace. 
booksent_2013_0033	She looked round the empty chamber; the rest of the party had evidently decided to go home, were already outside somewhere in the blundering snow. 
booksent_2013_0034	And from that day to this the Camel always wears a humph (we call it  hump now, not to hurt his feelings).
booksent_2013_0035	They had just walked off and hidden themselves in the shadowy forest. 
booksent_2013_0036	Not always was the Kangaroo as now we do behold him, but a Different Animal with four short legs.
booksent_2013_0037	In the very middle of those times was a Stickly Prickly Hedgehog, and he lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating shelly snails and things. 
booksent_2013_0038	And he had a friend, a Slow Solid Tortoise, who lived on the banks of the turbid Amazon, eating green lettuces and things.
booksent_2013_0039	From that day to this the Moon has always pulled the sea up and down and made what we call the tides. 
booksent_2013_0040	He didn't even begin to be tame till he met the Woman, and she told him that she did not like living in his wild ways.
booksent_2013_0041	He will kill mice and he will be kind to Babies when he is in the house, just as long as they do not pull his tail too hard.
booksent_2013_0042	He understood what the rocks said deep under the earth when they bowed in towards each other and groaned.
booksent_2013_0043	Cedric's good opinion of the advantages of being an earl increased greatly during the next week.
booksent_2013_0044	A few seconds later they saw him struggle through the crowd on the lower deck, and rush on shore just before the gang plank was drawn in.
booksent_2013_0045	The fact was that Mrs. Errol had thought it better not to tell him why this plan had been made. 
booksent_2013_0046	"He had picked up this sea faring remark from an ""elderly naval man"" of the name of Jerry, who told him stories in which it occurred frequently."
booksent_2013_0047	He seldom argued with his lordly patron, never when his lordly patron's noble leg was inflamed by gout. 
booksent_2013_0048	Their mother stood courtesying and smiling, and the children, on receiving a sign from her, made bobbing little courtesies too. 
booksent_2013_0050	Cedric had never seen such trees, they were so grand and stately, and their branches grew so low down on their huge trunks. 
booksent_2013_0051	Once a covey of partridges rose with a sudden whir and flew away, and then he shouted and clapped his hands. 
booksent_2013_0052	There was a fire on the hearth, and the sunshine was streaming in through the ivy entwined windows.
booksent_2013_0053	The carriage rolled slowly away, but his lordship did not at once lean back; he still looked out.
booksent_2013_0054	People appeared upon the scene who seldom did him the honor of coming to hear his sermons. 
booksent_2013_0055	She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear. 
booksent_2013_0056	Alice looked up, and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded, frowning like a thunderstorm. 
booksent_2013_0057	o they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with large eyes full of tears, but said nothing. 
booksent_2013_0058	Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice.
booksent_2013_0059	But there seemed to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about her, to pass away the time. 
booksent_2013_0060	This of course, Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away. 
booksent_2013_0061	They had a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings: into this they slipped the guinea pig, head first, and then sat upon it.
booksent_2013_0062	They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when the White Rabbit interrupted
booksent_2013_0063	The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark.
booksent_2013_0064	There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house, and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it.
booksent_2013_0065	The Hatter's remark seemed to have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English. 
booksent_2013_0066	Then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it in her pocket) till she was about a foot high.
booksent_2013_0067	Even Waythorn could not but admit that she had discovered the solution of the newest social problem. 
booksent_2013_0068	If there had been any element of passion in the transaction he would have felt less deteriorated by it.
booksent_2013_0069	She reminded him of a juggler tossing knives; but the knives were blunt and she knew they would never cut her. 
booksent_2013_0070	He had drifted into a dulling propinquity with Haskett and Varick and he took refuge in the cheap revenge of satirizing the situation.
booksent_2013_0071	His wife knew exactly how to manage the lights, and he knew exactly to what training she owed her skill.
booksent_2013_0072	He ceased to satirize himself because time dulled the irony of the situation and the joke lost its humor with its sting.
booksent_2013_0073	He opened his cigar case and held it out to his visitor, and Haskett's acceptance seemed to mark a fresh stage in their intercourse. 
booksent_2013_0074	She came in fresh and smiling, in her street dress and hat, shedding a fragrance from the boa which she loosened in advancing. 
booksent_2013_0075	The three men stood awkwardly before her, till Varick, always the most self possessed, dashed into an explanatory phrase. 
booksent_2013_0076	She dropped into her low chair by the tea table, and the two visitors, as if drawn by her smile, advanced to receive the cups she held out. 
booksent_2013_0077	She pretended to be examining their texture, which the clerk assured her was excellent. 
booksent_2013_0078	Then she replaced her shoes, rolled the cotton stockings together and thrust them into her bag.
booksent_2013_0079	After doing this she crossed straight over to the shoe department and took her seat to be fitted. 
booksent_2013_0080	There were books and magazines piled up in the window of a stall a few paces down the street.
booksent_2013_0081	Then she picked up a magazine and glanced through it, cutting the pages with a blunt edge of her knife.
booksent_2013_0082	What did it matter about a name when he could give her one of the oldest and proudest in Louisiana?
booksent_2013_0083	Big, solemn oaks grew close to it, and their thick leaved, far reaching branches shadowed it like a pall. 
booksent_2013_0084	The young mother was recovering slowly, and lay full length, in her soft white muslins and laces, upon a couch.
booksent_2013_0085	The blood turned like ice in her veins, and a clammy moisture gathered upon her face. 
booksent_2013_0086	He laid aside the great, soft fan, and obediently stole away, over the polished floor, on his bare tiptoes. 
booksent_2013_0087	She stayed motionless, with gaze riveted upon her child, and her face the picture of fright. 
booksent_2013_0088	He coldly but gently loosened her fingers from about his arm and thrust the hand away from him.
booksent_2013_0089	She gave some to Toto, and taking a pail from the shelf she carried it down to the little brook and filled it with clear, sparkling water. 
booksent_2013_0090	It was gingham, with checks of white and blue; and although the blue was somewhat faded with many washings, it was still a pretty frock.
booksent_2013_0091	Within a short time she was walking briskly toward the Emerald City, her silver shoes tinkling merrily on the hard, yellow road bed. 
booksent_2013_0092	There was a great cornfield beyond the fence, and not far away she saw a Scarecrow, placed high on a pole to keep the birds from the ripe corn. 
booksent_2013_0093	There were fewer houses and fewer fruit trees, and the farther they went the more dismal and lonesome the country became. 
booksent_2013_0094	After an hour or so the light faded away, and they found themselves stumbling along in the darkness. 
booksent_2013_0095	When she had finished her meal, and was about to go back to the road of yellow brick, she was startled to hear a deep groan near by. 
booksent_2013_0096	is head and arms and legs were jointed upon his body, but he stood perfectly motionless, as if he could not stir at all. 
booksent_2013_0097	But the Tin Woodman set to work with his axe and chopped so well that soon he cleared a passage for the entire party. 
booksent_2013_0098	What worried her most was that the bread was nearly gone, and another meal for herself and Toto would empty the basket.
booksent_2013_0099	But now and then there came a deep growl from some wild animal hidden among the trees. 
booksent_2013_0100	But, to the Lion's surprise, he could make no impression on the tin, although the Woodman fell over in the road and lay still.
